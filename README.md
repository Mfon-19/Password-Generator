# Password Generator

Hello readers! :D

This project is a simple password generator implemented in Java. It provides two main functionalities: checking the strength of a given password and generating a new password based on user preferences.

## Features

### Password Strength Checker

The password strength checker allows users to evaluate the strength of a given password based on the presence of various criteria:

- At least one uppercase letter
- At least one lowercase letter
- At least one digit
- At least one special symbol

Upon entering a password, the system analyzes it and provides feedback on whether it meets the specified criteria.

### Password Generator

The password generator allows users to create a new password with custom criteria. Users can choose whether to include the following in their password:

- Uppercase letters
- Lowercase letters
- Digits
- Special symbols

Additionally, users can specify the length of the password they wish to generate. After providing their preferences, the system generates a password meeting the specified criteria.

## Usage

To use the password generator, simply run the `PasswordGenerator.java` file. You will be prompted to choose between checking the strength of a password or generating a new password.

### Checking Password Strength

To check the strength of a password, select the corresponding option from the menu and enter the password when prompted. The system will analyze the password and provide feedback on its strength.

### Generating a New Password

To generate a new password, select the corresponding option from the menu. You will be prompted to specify the criteria for the password, including whether to include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special symbols. Additionally, specify the desired length of the password. The system will then generate and display the new password.
